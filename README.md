# Justin Calleja ‚Äì Data Science Portfolio

Welcome!  
My name is Justin Mitchel Calleja, and I'm a Master‚Äôs student in Data Science, Big Data & Analytics at Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

My professional journer began with a Bachelor's in International Studies, which led to roles in the Senate of the Philippines and later as an English teacher in Spain. 
I am now transitioning into the data field and currently work as a Data Marketer at Launchmetrics.

This portfolio showcases my work in **EDA, machine learning, big data pipelines, and dashboards.**
